Python Testing Project
This project demonstrates unit testing and integration testing techniques using Python's built-in unittest framework. It also covers essential testing practices such as mocking, parametrization, memoization, and the difference between unit and integration tests.

ðŸ§ª Objectives
By the end of this project, you will be able to:

Differentiate between unit and integration testing.
Use unittest to write and execute tests.
Apply mocking with unittest.mock to isolate test logic.
Use parametrization for testing with multiple input values.
Understand and apply memoization in test scenarios.
Write clean, documented, and type-annotated Python code that is testable.
ðŸ§° Tools & Resources
Python 3.7
unittest â€” Unit testing framework
unittest.mock â€” Mock object library
parameterized â€” For running parameterized tests
Resources:
unittest docs
mock docs
Memoization in Python
âœ… Requirements
All code is tested and executable on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS with Python 3.7
Follow pycodestyle (version 2.5) formatting
Every Python file ends with a new line
All files are executable and start with #!/usr/bin/env python3
Full documentation is provided for:
Modules
Classes
Functions (inside and outside classes)
All functions and coroutines are fully type-annotated
ðŸš€ Running Tests
Use the following command to execute tests:

python3 -m unittest path/to/test_file.py
